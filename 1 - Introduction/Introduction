This project focuses on designing and developing a Recipe Management System, a Java-based desktop application that allows users to create, manage, and search their personal recipes.
We aim to simplify the process of storing and accessing culinary information with mindfulness on a user-friendly experience. In traditional alternatives, there is a lack of organization and limited accessible tools for individuals who enjoy cooking and want to manage their recipes. Existing solutions are often either overly complicated or too limited in functionality. We wish to modernize the experience to be convenient and approachable.
