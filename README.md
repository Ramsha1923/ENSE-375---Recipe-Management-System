## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on designing and developing a Recipe Management System, a Java-based desktop application that allows users to create, manage, and search their personal recipes.  
We aim to simplify the process of storing and accessing culinary information with mindfulness of a user-friendly experience. In traditional alternatives, there is a lack of organization and limited accessible tools for individuals who enjoy cooking and want to manage their recipes. Existing solutions are often either overly complicated or too limited in functionality. We wish to modernize the experience to be convenient and approachable.

## 2. Design Problem
### 2.1	Problem Definition
#### Challenges with Current Recipe Organization Methods:
**1.	Lack of Centralized Storage:**
There are no established ways to consolidate handwritten recipes, printed cookbooks and bookmarked websites for easy viewing and retrieval.<br>
**2.	Complexity of Existing Platforms:**
Popular recipe organizing programs often provide more features than are necessary for simple users, leading to increased complexity and difficulty.<br>
**3.	Limited Customization Options:**
Existing platforms often donâ€™t allow users to fully control their data or customize their recipe entries, such as adding personalized tags or categorizing based on meal type.
#### Advantages of Implementing a Digital Recipe Management Tool:
**1.	Streamlined Organization:**
A dedicated desktop application allows recipes to be categorized, tagged, and searched quickly, enabling easy access to meal ideas.<br>
**2.	Intuitive User Experience:**
A simplified interface focused solely on recipe management avoids clutter and enhances usability for users of all skill levels.<br>
**3.	Offline Functionality:**
Unlike web-based platforms, this application will function fully offline, ensuring availability in all environments, including kitchens with limited connectivity.<br>
#### Rationale:
The need for this project became clear after observing the difficulties faced by home cooks and hobbyists in managing recipes effectively. Paper-based systems are prone to damage and disorganization, while online platforms often come with distractions or require internet access. Our proposed Recipe Management System addresses these issues by offering a simple, efficient, and accessible way to store and retrieve recipes, without unnecessary complications.

### 2.2	Design Requirements
From our vision and outlined design problem, we are putting an emphasis on the database interactivity and readability of our program, focusing on its core functions and how users will interact with them. 

#### 2.2.1	Functions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.  Create/store a recipe:** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Ability to create or upload a recipe in-app.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Ability to save the recipe for later use.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.  Viewing a recipe:** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Ability to retrieve a saved recipe when needed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Ability to retrieve said recipe on different devices, such as a desktop computer, phone, or tablet. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.  Ability to view recipes while offline.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**3.  Organizing recipes:** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Ability to apply custom tags/filters to recipes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Ability to sort by custom tags. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.  Ability to search from saved recipes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.  Ability to favourite recipes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.  Ability to remove recipes that are no longer needed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**4.  Sharing recipes:** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Ability to back-up a collection of recipes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Ability to share a collection of recipes with another user. <br>

#### 2.2.2	Objectives
Provide objectives of the design project. Remember that the objectives are specified as adjectives.
#### 2.2.3	Constraints
Provide constraints here. Remember that the constraints are binary (either satisfied or not).
